March Madness 2017

An attempt at predicting the March Madness 2017 bracket with machine learning models. 

Process began with data wrangling and data cleaning between the csv files and then models were trained with Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Boosting.

R files should run as is

Things to implement:
  Algorithm for simulating the tournament rather than brute forcing each round as is currently.
  Fine tune models and try other ones as well.
